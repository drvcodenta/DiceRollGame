# DiceRollGame

This simple dice roll game displays a dice face (represented by a number between 1 and 6) and allows the user to roll the dice by clicking a button. The rollDice function generates a random number and updates the displayed number on the dice. The styling is kept minimal for clarity, but you can enhance it based on your preferences.
